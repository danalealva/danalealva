### Hey, I'm Dani 👋

I'm a data analyst in training with a background in hospitality, a passion for ethical AI, and a curious eye for hidden patterns in messy datasets.

📍 Currently based in Barcelona, but my heart might be headed to Madrid or Paris  
🎓 Studying at Nuclio Digital School · Learning by doing with **Python**, **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **Looker**  
🧠 Final project: uncovering algorithmic bias in the **COMPAS** criminal risk prediction system  
🔎 I care deeply about how tech shapes society, and I'm building skills to be part of that conversation  
📷 On the side: analog photography enthusiast, starting out with a Pentax ME Super and expired film  
🌍 Fluent in **Spanish**, **English**, and **French**

- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Data viz**: Looker Studio, Tableau  
- **Databases**: SQLite, PostgreSQL

### 🚧 Projects in Progress

I'm currently working on:
